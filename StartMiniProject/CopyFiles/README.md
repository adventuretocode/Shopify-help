Created project to download and upload files.

Only file images for now

`downloadFiles.js` is used to download all the files
`createFile.js` is used to upload files to another store

Note* we aren't downloading the actual files, but rather using the link from the previous store

TODO: 
- There is a "staging" API for files if its not already hosted
- Turn this into a bulk file create
